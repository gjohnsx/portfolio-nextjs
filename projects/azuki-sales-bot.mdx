## Why I built it in the first place

There used to be an Azuki sales bot on Twitter, but like many accounts on the platform it was arbitrarily suspended.

It was January of 2021, and I was only 6 months in to my programming education. 
I wondered how a Twitter bot even worked on a basic level. 

I decided to investigate, and in so doing I learned about:
- How to use an API
- How to get data from a blockchain
- How to use AWS Lambda

The end result was a Twitter account that posts sales updates for 2 monitored Ethereum contracts.

Here's a recent example from August 9, 2022:
![Screenshot of the AzukiSales bot on Twitter, posting a notification that Azuki #9721 had sold for 7.8 Ethereum, which at the time of the screenshot was worth $13,336.83.](/images/projects/azuki-sales-bot/azuki-sale-8-9-2022.png)

### How it works

Every 5 minutes, the program gets the Ethereum block number that was mined 5 minutes ago. 
Then it checks all interactions with a given contract, and checks if there had been anything that looks like a sale.
If there was a sale, we save the image from the token metadata to local storage, upload it to Twitter, and then create a Tweet with the sales information and the image.

### How my brain worked

It was more difficult than I thought to just look at a transaction and be able to say, "Yep, that's a sale." There were a ton of weird transactions to sort through. And often a new contract would pop up that would be a new exception that I would have to learn, and then would have to teach the bot (like a new multi-purchase contract, or a lending protocol).
Because of this, my functions are very long with a lot of If/Else trees -- pretty ugly!
Multiple times I had to rethink through the logic of how I was getting data and how I needed to manipulate it. 
I tried to think computationally and follow this basic formula:

- Try to come up with the logical steps first, and fill in the blanks with functions that you can abstract later
- Try to make the data that you get from the blockchain and what you do with it as DRY as possible

### Conclusion

I felt like a million bucks when one of the developers from Azuki reached out to me to offer any assistance in getting the bot up and running.

That was the highlight of my young programming career! It felt great to contribute to an online community.

## From this project, I gained the passion and the desire to learn more so that I can contribute more in the web3 world that I want to live in.
