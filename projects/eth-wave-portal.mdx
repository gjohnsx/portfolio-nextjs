Send a message and store it permanently on the (goerli testnet) blockchain!

Check out the [Github](https://github.com/gjohnsx/eth-wave-portal) to see the simple Solidity smart contracts for this project.

## Technology
- Create-react-app for the single page app
- Ethers.js to connect to wallet and execute smart contracts
- TailwindCSS and TailwindUI components for styling
- Notifications that change depending on transaction status

I know it's sketchy connecting your wallet to random sites (I hope you're using a test wallet on a separate browser for dev stuff!). So I added a short demo video on the home page to see what the app looks like.
