## What I did
I wrote some loops so [The Plague NFT](https://twitter.com/ThePlagueNFT) could pull user engagement data from their tweets during their whitelist giveaway process.

The founder was able to see which users were engaged with their tweets and to what degree.

This helped them select users to add to the whitelist.

## Web App Under Construction
I'm working on changing this into a web app where anyone can pull Liker/Retweeter data.
