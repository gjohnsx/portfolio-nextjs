Hello,


I'm listening to the Discord conversation right now, and I'm very much enjoying it. 


I'm a digital marketer and growth strategist who's trying to become a fullstack web3 developer. I would very much like to work on the front end of the web app, and so I'm submitting my portfolio and resume for review.

I included a few links in the hero of my portfolio site that give some insight into why I'm switching careers and why I'm passionate about becoming a developer. My favorite part about those articles though are the featured image for each one.... I encourage you to check them out! 


As a digital marketer, I'm most fascinated by these aspects:
- Having to try to slow growth down, but still experiencing a huge influx of people
- Depending on centralized platforms who've been known to arbitrarily censor people and companies
- Not wanting to have to rebuild the feature set of Discord, but maintaining the magic of community on your own web app




Personally, I'm absolutely blown away by this tool and by its potential. After having used the bot for a few days, I find my imagination much more active and fanciful. 
Using the bot has forced me to try to categorize and describe the images I have in my head. I can see how this is going to be such a powerful tool for encouraging people to bring to life the things inside their heads.
The mutual learning -- us learning from the bot, the bot learning from us -- is going to produce amazing art.


I'm reminded of a quote from The Sovereign Individual:


Merit, wherever it arises, will be rewarded as never before. In an environment where the greatest source of wealth will be the ideas you have in your head rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly will potentially be rich. The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of humans in parts of the world that never shared fully in the prosperity of industrial society. The brightest, most successful and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals.
I can see a scene from the future now: My daughter, my wife and I are wearing our AR spectacles. My daughter describes a scene from her imagination, and we are instantly transported into her world -- a spaceship in orbit around Earth, as we listen to a lecture about the universe.


I want to help build the tools that get us to that world.
