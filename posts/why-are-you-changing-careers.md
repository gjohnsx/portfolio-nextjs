The TL;DR is that I want to build cool things.

### Replace the centralized technologies I've used

I want to create the open, decentralized version of the technologies that I've used as a digital marketer.

At the press of a key. Thatâ€™s not the right balance of power. BTC/web3 shifts leverage back to individuals."](/images/posts/why-are-you-changing-careers/balaji-s-tweet-8-1-2022.png "Balaji on BTC and Web3")

#### Decentralized Truth vs Corporate Truth

Google is supposed to be the unbiased source for information. But they curate search results, and they don't tell you how they're doing that.
Good luck finding anything useful about any politically sensitive topic on YouTube. Forget about independent media.  Do you think you'll find both sides of any story?

I want to help build the world where the central-hub-and-spoke model of information dissemination no longer exists.

> What we are doing is establishing an **alternate hub** around nakamoto consensus (which is more powerful than their hub and makes more money than their hub), but it's more global, more internationalist, more mathematical, and more programmable.

Balaji S. in his [fireside chat with Ryan Selkis](https://youtu.be/bUoY9z-BNbk?t=5423) (a must watch!).

Decentralization is where the exciting things are being built. dApps are what have the potential to change the world for the better, and I can't resist the calling to follow my heart and work on things that I truly believe will benefit humanity.

### Unsatisfied with not knowing how to build ideas that I have

The more I learned about web3 and decentralized networks, the more ideas I started to have. Still today, I have ideas that seem so fantastical but are absolutely possible with decentralization.

The more ideas I had, the more I wanted to know how to actually build them. I wasn't going to be able to make what I wanted with a WordPress site. So I had to learn how to code in order to at least be able to create an MVP.

Recently, I spend a lot of time imagining what I think the perfect user experience would be for these decentralized apps. The UX has to be better than what we currently have today, and we're a long way from there.

Getting scammed easily has to be nearly impossible. Sending and receiving tokens has to be as easy as scanning a QR code to make a payment. Using a decentralized web app has to be easier and safer than logging into your bank account.

I believe that we are going to get there, and I think it's helpful to start thinking far in the future and building our way backwards to the front end and then to the smart contracts.

### Inflation

I want to build the systems that people will use in a post-fiat world.

I want to protect myself from inflation by learning a skill that's globally mobile.

> Inflation as revenue option will be largely forclosed by the emrgence of cybermoney.
> New technologies will allow the holders of wealth to bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money in the modern period. 
>
> In the information age, individuals will be able to use cyber currencies and thus declare their monetary independence. When individuals can conduct their own monetary policies over the world wide web, it will matter less - or not at all - that the state continues to control the industrial era printing presses. Their importance for controlling the world's wealth will be transcended by mathemetical algorithms that have no physical existence.
