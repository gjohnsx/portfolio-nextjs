### Strapi CMS
I just learned about Strapi CMS while reading about headless CMSs on [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/).

Building a front end makes so much more sense when you have the freedom to create any sort of API that you want.

You start thinking in a much more composable way earlier on. You design whatever front end you want, however you want it. And you don't have to worry about how to connect it to your backend. 

From what I understand, Strapi lets you create any kind of API you need to hydrate your components however you set them up.

## Strapi frees your creative mind.
