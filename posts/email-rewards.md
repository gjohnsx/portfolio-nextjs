*The 'ideas' posts are unfinished, quick ideas that I want to write down somewhere and revisit later if it's a good enough idea to remember it.*

It's annoying that I bought something at Ace and my only 'reward' was getting another email when I got home asking how my experience was. 
My experience was buying 1 bag of wood chips - not all that exciting. In and out for one item. I wonder what percentage of sales at Ace are like that? (I wonder what the average purchase is compared to Home Depot for the non-business customer...)

What if you could better incentive users to take action as a rewards member?
Instead of just asking me for a review on every single purchase every time I go, what if after 10 reviews (of verifiably purchased products), I knew I would get a coupon for some percentage off? 
What other actions could you get customers to take through email rewards instead of just asking for something?

Benefits of more reviews:
- better seo
- more social proof on indivual products
- more social proof as a brand 

Customers are more likely to return to Ace.

Need to look up who's doing email marketing well.
