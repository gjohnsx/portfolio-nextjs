#### August, 2021

I began my first MITx course on EdX in August of 2021. That course changed my life. I fell in love with computer programming and computational thinking, and I learned how I could start to use a computer as an extension of my brain.

From there, I started learning more about blockchains, NFTs, and decentralization.

My focus has been on becoming a fullstack web3 developer with the following tech stack:

- React
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Ethers.js

## Things that didn't work

### Nucamp Coding Bootcamp

I signed up for the course after watching an [interview with the CEO of nucamp](https://youtu.be/MUwvbE2n3y4). In it, he said that you take a bootcamp for the structure and the support, not for the curriculum. He admitted that you can find a better curriculum for free online (*I did, and it's called [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)*). But you take a bootcamp for the wrapper around the curriculum: the instructors, the classmates, the network, the career services.

In my 4 weeks at Nucamp, I found the curriculum to be outdated and bland, the instruction to be mediocre, and the energy and enthusiasm of the cohort to be lethargic. There was no collaboration or communication happening during the week, and even during the Saturday lectures it was awkward and quiet. Nobody really wanted to participate, it seemed. There is better discourse and networking happening in the [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) and [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) Discord servers than there is anywhere in Nucamp, in my experience.

For that reason, I dropped out after 4 weeks and am continuing my self directed journey.
